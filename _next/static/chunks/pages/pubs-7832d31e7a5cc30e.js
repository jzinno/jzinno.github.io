While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a ′temporal microscope′, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost-efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors′ and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors′ exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to ~35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan."},{title:"Single-cell mapping of regulatory DNA:Protein interactions",authors:["Wei-Yu Chi","Sang-Ho Yoon","Evrim Goksel","Levan Mekerishvili","Joe Pelt","Yiyun Lin","Tamara Prieto","John Zinno","Saravanan Ganesan","Catherine Potenski","Franco Izzo","Dan A.

These complex networks have been shown to be disrupted during aging, disease, and cancer. However, profiling these networks across diverse cell types and states has been limited due to the technical constraints of existing methods for mapping DNA:Protein interactions in single cells. As a result, a critical gap remains in understanding where TFs or other chromatin remodelers bind to DNA and how these interactions are perturbed in pathological contexts. To address this challenge, we developed a transformative single-cell immuno-tethering DNA:Protein mapping technology. By coupling a species-specific antibody-binding nanobody to a cytosine base editing enzyme, this approach enables profiling of even weak or transient factor binding to DNA, a task that was previously unachievable in single cells. Thus, our Docking & Deamination followed by sequencing (D&D-seq) technique induces cytosine-to-uracil edits in genomic regions bound by the target protein, offering a novel means to capture DNA:Protein interactions with unprecedented resolution. Importantly, this technique can be seamlessly incorporated into common single-cell multiomics workflows, enabling multimodal analysis of gene regulation in single cells. We tested the ability of D&D-seq to record TF binding both in bulk and at the single-cell level by profiling CTCF and GATA family members, obtaining high specificity and efficiency, with clear identification of TF footprint and signal retention in the targeted cell subpopulations. Furthermore, the deamination reaction showed minimal off-target activity, with high concordance to bulk ChIP-seq reference data. Applied to primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), D&D-seq successfully identified CTCF binding sites and enabled integration with advanced machine-learning algorithms for predicting 3D chromatin structure. Furthermore, we integrated D&D-seq with single-cell genotyping to assess the impact of IDH2 mutations on CTCF binding in a human clonal hematopoiesis sample, uncovering altered binding and chromatin co-accessibility patterns in mutant cells. Altogether, D&D-seq represents an important technological advance enabling the direct mapping of TF or chromatin remodeler binding to the DNA in primary human samples, opening new avenues for understanding chromatin and transcriptional regulation in health and disease."},{title:"Measuring Longitudinal Genome-wide Clonal Evolution of Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at Single-Cell Resolution",journal:"bioRxiv",authors:["Yakun Pang","Tamara Prieto","Veronica Gonzalez-Pena","Athena Aragon","Yuntao Xia","Sheng Kao","Sri Rajagopalan","John Zinno","Jean Quentin","Julien Laval","Dennis Yuan","Nathaniel Omans","David Klein","Matthew MacKay","Iwijn De Vlaminck","John Easton","William Evans","Dan A.

While bulk sequencing studies indicate that pALL cells contain relatively few genetic variants compared to other cancers, the true extent of genetic diversity at the single-cell level remains unknown. Here, we used three complementary approaches to investigate pALL genetic heterogeneity: error-corrected bulk sequencing, single-cell exome sequencing, and primary template-directed amplification (PTA)-enabled single-cell genome sequencing. We discovered that some ETV6-RUNX1 samples harbor multiple independent ras clones and that individual pALL cells harbor substantially more mutations (mean 3,553 per cell) than detected in bulk samples (mean 965 mutations), with variant signatures suggesting both early and late APOBEC-driven mutagenesis in ETV6-RUNX1 patients. Using PTA-based phylogenetic analysis of over 150 single-cell genomes from four pALL patients, we identified heritable phenotypes associated with specific genetic alterations, including some low-frequency clones that are preferentially selected for during chemotherapy treatment. Our findings reveal previously undetected genetic diversity in pALL and suggest that pre-existing mutations influence treatment response, with implications for future therapeutic strategies. This study provides a high-resolution framework for understanding cancer clonal evolution during treatment, yielding important new insights for developing more effective therapeutic approaches for pALL."},{title:"Genotype-to-phenotype mapping of somatic clonal mosaicism via single-cell co-capture of DNA mutations and mRNA transcripts",journal:"bioRxiv",authors:["Dennis J Yuan","John Zinno","Theo Botella","Dalia Dhingra","Shu Wang","Allegra Hawkins","Ariel Swett","Jesus Sotelo","Ramya Raviram","Clayton Hughes","Catherine Potenski","Akira Yokoyama","Nobuyuki Kakiuchi","Seishi Ogawa","Dan A Landau"],doi:"doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.22.595241",featureImage:"/scG2P.png",abstract:"Somatic mosaicism is a hallmark of malignancy that is also pervasively observed in human physiological aging, with clonal expansions of cells harboring mutations in recurrently mutated driver genes. Bulk sequencing of tissue microdissection captures mutation frequencies, but cannot distinguish which mutations co-occur in the same clones to reconstruct clonal architectures, nor phenotypically profile clonal populations to delineate how driver mutations impact cellular behavior. To address these challenges, we developed single-cell Genotype-to-Phenotype sequencing (scG2P) for high-throughput, highly-multiplexed, single-cell joint capture of recurrently mutated genomic regions and mRNA phenotypic markers in cells or nuclei isolated from solid tissues. We applied scG2P to aged esophagus samples from five individuals with high alcohol and tobacco exposure and observed a clonal landscape dominated by a large number of clones with a single driver event, but only rare clones with two driver mutations. NOTCH1 mutants dominate the clonal landscape and are linked to stunted epithelial differentiation, while TP53 mutants and double-driver mutants promote clonal expansion through both differentiation biases and increased cell cycling. Thus, joint single-cell highly multiplexed capture of somatic mutations and mRNA transcripts enables high resolution reconstruction of clonal architecture and associated phenotypes in solid tissue somatic mosaicism."},{title:"Omicron Spike protein has a positive electrostatic surface that promotes ACE2 recognition and antibody escape",journal:"Frontiers in Virology",authors:["Hin Hark Gan","John Zinno","Fabio Piano","Kristin C Gunsalus"],doi:"doi.org/10.3389/fviro.2022.894531",featureImage:"/omicron.png",abstract:"High transmissibility is a hallmark of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the molecular determinants of Omicron’s transmissibility will impact development of intervention strategies. Here we map the electrostatic potential surface of the Spike protein to show that major SARS-CoV-2 variants have accumulated positive charges in solvent-exposed regions of the Spike protein, especially its ACE2-binding interface. Significantly, the Omicron Spike-ACE2 complex has complementary electrostatic surfaces. In contrast, interfaces between Omicron and neutralizing antibodies tend to have similar positively charged surfaces. Structural modeling demonstrates that the electrostatic property of Omicron’s Spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) plays a role in enhancing ACE2 recognition and destabilizing Spike-antibody complexes. Specifically, the Omicron S RBD has favorable electrostatic interaction energy with ACE2 that is 3-5 times greater than the Delta variant over a range of 20 \xc5, implying efficient recognition of host receptors. Computed binding affinities of six representative S RBD-antibody complexes show that Omicron can escape most antibodies targeting the ACE2-binding region of S RBD. Interestingly, a straightforward assessment of the electrostatic surfaces of 18 neutralizing antibodies correctly predicted the Omicron escape status of 80% of cases. Collectively, our structural analysis implies that Omicron S RBD interaction interfaces have been optimized to simultaneously promote access to human ACE2 receptors and evade antibodies. These findings suggest that electrostatic interactions are a major contributing factor for increased Omicron transmissibility relative to other variants."},{title:"The Caenorhabditis elegans TDRD5/7-like protein, LOTR-1, interacts with the helicase ZNFX-1 to balance epigenetic signals in the germline",journal:"PLoS Genetics",authors:["Elisabeth A.

The homologous proteins in mammals, TDRD5 and TDRD7, are required during spermiogenesis. Until now, proteins containing both LOTUS and Tudor domains in Caenorhabditis elegans have remained elusive. Here we describe LOTR-1 (D1081.7), which derives its name from its LOTUS and Tudor domains. Interestingly, LOTR-1 docks next to P granules to colocalize with the broadly conserved Z-granule helicase, ZNFX-1. The Tudor domain of LOTR-1 is required for its Z-granule retention. Like znfx-1 mutants, lotr-1 mutants lose small RNAs from the 3’ ends of WAGO and mutator targets, reminiscent of the loss of piRNAs from the 3’ ends of piRNA precursor transcripts in mouse Tdrd5 mutants. Our work shows that LOTR-1 acts with ZNFX-1 to bring small RNA amplifying mechanisms towards the 3’ ends of its RNA templates."},{title:"Novel LOTUS-domain proteins are organizational hubs that recruit C. elegans Vasa to germ granules",journal:"eLife",authors:["Patricia Giselle Cipriani","Olivia Bay","John Zinno","Michelle Gutwein","Hin Hark Gan","George Chung","Jia-Xuan Chen","Hala Fahs","Yu Guan","Thomas F Duchaine","Matthias Selbach","Fabio Piano","Kristin C Gunsalus"],doi:"doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60833",featureImage:"/mips.png",abstract:"We describe MIP-1 and MIP-2, novel paralogous C. elegans germ granule components that interact with the intrinsically disordered MEG-3 protein.

MIP-1 and MIP-2 each contain two LOTUS domains and intrinsically disordered regions and form homo- and heterodimers. They bind and anchor the Vasa homolog GLH-1 within P granules and are jointly required for coalescence of MEG-3, GLH-1, and PGL proteins. Animals lacking MIP-1 and MIP-2 show temperature-sensitive embryonic lethality, sterility, and mortal germ lines. Germline phenotypes include defects in stem cell self-renewal, meiotic progression, and gamete differentiation.
